# ELIMcollection Fork
This is a collection of good C++ implementations of some image processing algorithms. This is a fork: the original repository contained errors and useless stuff, so I decided to write better versions of the algorithms. This fork lacks some of the implementations of the original repo. This fork was made for educational purposes: it's been used as a preparation for the Image Processing practicle exam at the University of Naples "Parthenope". Big thanks to the original repo owner.

*NOTE: splitMerge.cpp needs further testing for now.

## Introduction
This is a simple collection of OpenCV C++ examples.
We hope those examples will help people understanding digital image processing.:v: :v:

:it: *The pdf is in ITALIAN language!* :it:

## Requirements
You must install [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d9/df8/tutorial_root.html) in order to compile files. The algorithms have been tested on GNU/Linux only.

## Collection
There is a *.pdf* file containing some most important arguments of digital image processing.

Our collection is composed by:

- Low Pass Filters 
- High Pass Filters
- Histogram EQ (Cap. 9)
- Canny Edge Detection (Cap. 5.2)
- Harris Corner Detection (Cap. 5.1)
- Hough Transform Lines (Cap. 4.1)
- Hough Transform Circles (Cap. 4.2)
- Distance Transform (Cap. 7)
- Split and Merge (Cap. 6.2)
- Region Growing (B/W) (Cap. 6.1)
- Region Growing (Color) (Cap. 6.1)
- K-Means (Cap. 3.1)
- Background Subtraction (Cap. 8.1)
- Optical Flux (Cap. 8.2)
